# But if you would like to use non-standard inputs (such as SDMX) then you can
# use this as needed.
#
# Each item must have a "class" which corresponds to classes in the sdg/inputs

# The config below shows usage for importing SDMX-JSON.

# Each item must have a "class" which corresponds to classes in the sdg/translations
