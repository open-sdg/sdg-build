# SDG Build

SDG Build is a Python package for converting data on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) from one format into another. This is mainly useful to an SDG reporting platform, by providing these benefits:

1. Input of SDG data from various machine-readable formats, for human-friendly visualisation and display
2. Output of SDG data to various machine-readable formats, for interoperability with other systems
3. Validation of the data and metadata for quality control

## Dependencies

* Python 3.7 or higher

## Inputs

SDG Build can **input** SDG data in the following formats:

* Data in CSV files (long/tidy format)
* Data (and minimal metadata) from SDMX-JSON and SDMX-ML
* Data from a CKAN instance
* Metadata in YAML files
* Metadata in CSV files
* Metadata in Excel files

## Ouputs

SDG Build can **output** SDG data in the following formats:

* A particular JSON structure for data and metadata, expected by the [Open SDG](https://open-sdg.org) reporting platform.
* GeoJSON for mapping (there is not a global standard for SDG GeoJSON at this time, so this is our best guess at a useful structure)
* SDMX-ML output

## Alterations of data and metadata

Sometimes you may need to alter data and/or metadata before importing into this library. This can be done after instantiating the input objects, with `add_data_alteration` and `add_meta_alteration`. For example:

```
def my_data_alteration(df):
    # Drop an unnecessary column in the data.
    df = df.drop('unnecessary_column', axis='columns')
    return df
def my_meta_alteration(meta):
    # Drop an unecessary field in the metadata.
    del meta['unnecessary_field']
    return meta
my_data_input.add_data_alteration(my_data_alteration)
my_meta_input.add_meta_alteration(my_meta_alteration)
```

## Schemas

SDG Build requires a schema for any metadata. Currently the following formats are supported:

* YAML schema intended for Prose.io

## Translations

SDG Build can also import translations and use them to produce fully-translated builds. The translations can also be exported as well. Input formats include:

* SDMX DSD
* YAML local files
* YAML Git repository

The export formats include:

* JSON

### Metadata "subfolder" translations

Indicator metadata is expected to be simple key/value pairs, but translations can also be structured using a "subfolder" approach. With this approach, a full set of pre-translated key/value pairs can be placed in the metadata under the appropriate language code. For example, the following structure could be used to provide a Spanish translation of an indicator's name:

```
indicator_name: My English indicator name
es:
  indicator_name: My Spanish indicator name
```

When using the InputYamlMdMeta class, this can be accomplished by creating subfolders for each language code, and adding pre-translated versions of the YAML files there.

## Upcoming integrations

Other inputs and outputs are either under development or planned for the future:

* Output to SDMX, both SDMX-JSON and SDMX-ML
* Input and output from/to CSV-W

## Usage

Usage examples are available in `docs/examples`. In each of these examples, the output is generated in a `_site` folder. Before running these examples, make sure to run:

```
pip install -r docs/examples/requirements.txt
```

### Example #1: CSV + YAML to Open SDG - simple

An example conversion from CSV data and YAML metadata into JSON suitable for the Open SDG platform. This example uses a [configuration file](https://github.com/open-sdg/sdg-build/blob/master/docs/examples/open_sdg_config.yml) and helper functions (`open_sdg_check` and `open_sdg_build`) for the greatest simplicity:

```
python docs/examples/open_sdg_simple.py
```

### Example #2: CSV + YAML to Open SDG

An example conversion from CSV data and YAML metadata into JSON suitable for the Open SDG platform. This example (in contrast to the "simple" example above) uses no helper functions, in order to demonstrate how to use the various Python classes:

```
python docs/examples/open_sdg.py
```

### Example #3: SDMX-JSON to Open SDG

An example conversion from SDMX-JSON (from an API endpoint) into JSON suitable for the Open SDG platform:

```
python docs/examples/sdmx_json.py
```

### Example #4: SDMX-ML to Open SDG

An example conversion from SDMX-ML into JSON suitable for the Open SDG platform:

```
python docs/examples/sdmx_ml.py
```

### Example #5: CKAN instance to Open SDG

An example conversion from CKAN data to JSON suitable for the Open SDG platform:

```
python docs/examples/ckan.py
```

### Example #6: CSV to GeoJSON

An example conversion from CSV data to GeoJSON suitable for mapping:

```
python docs/examples/geojson.py
```
