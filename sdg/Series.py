    Indicator data can have multiple combinations of disaggregations, which are

    years (for example, 2008, 2009, and 2010) with the corresponding values (for
    example, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9) and a description of how it is disaggregated
    (for example, Female, Age 60+, Urban).

    Each series contains 'disaggregations' and 'values'. For example a series
    'disaggregations might look like this:
        {
            'Sex': 'Female',
            'Age': '60+',
            'Area': 'Urban'
